HOOK
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
We had it all, but now its not the same
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
You played your part, because u think u can



V1
Seventh grade, the start was bright
Me and my friends, we felt so right
Took the school like we were meant to reign
Every class, every hall
Had ‘em watching, had it all
School & teachers tried to pull the chain



Then the years went spinning fast and fast
Things got messy, couldn’t last
Now we’re ghosts in the same old halls, Jolene
Ain’t my fault, this ain’t my pain
Y’all switched up, but I’m the same
Pls dont be the one to play the fool



HOOK
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
Im telling u, woman, find you your own chance
Jolene, you know
I don’t lose, Jolene
Im still that bitch from the super bowl day, yeah (dont forget)



V2
Tenth grade had come around
Bridges burned, no lessons learned
Now we barely speak, and that’s just fine
And that boy? Nah, he’s like a joke
You can have him, he’s no GOAT
Your peace depends on what you choose, Jolene



Bridge
Me and my friends ran that schoolyard
Highs and lows and everything between
Good days rolled in like golden leaves
I sleep good, happy
‘Cause you can’t erase what’s history
I know my crew gon’ stand by me
Breathing in my memories



Choir outro
I crossed those hallways, highs and lows and everything between
Good days rolled in like golden leaves
Good and happy
‘Cause you can’t erase what’s history
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
I’m gonna stand by them, they gon’ stand by me, Jolene
I’ma stand by mine, they gon’ stand by me
I’ma stand by them, they gon’ stand by me
I’ma stand by mine, they gon’ stand by me, Jolene
